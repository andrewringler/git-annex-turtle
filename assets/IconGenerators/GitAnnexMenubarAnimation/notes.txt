- run sketch, saving frames.
- run through icons with quick preview to get a sense for which frames
  would create a nice seemless loop
- create movie from frames with Processing Movie Maker
- preview in Quicktime with looping enabled, ended up having one extra frame,
  re-export with frames 0-16, made nice seemless loop :)!
- crop to 44px (since this canvas size is too small for Processing)
