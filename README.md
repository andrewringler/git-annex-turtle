# git-annex-mac
*git-annex-mac* provides git-annex status updates on the Mac via integration with Finder and a Menubar icon (aka menubar extra). This app relies on the Finder Sync API so is only available on OS-X 10.10 (Yosemite) and later.

## Build a Release
 * Open mac-experiments2/git-annex-turtle.xcodeproj in XCode 9.2
 * Click on the git-annex-turtle scheme (to the right of the triangle play button top of screen), click Edit Scheme, Make sure Run > Build Configuration is set to Release
 * Select the Scheme 'git-annex-turtle' then build: Product > Build 
 * You will find the .app in Open the ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ directory and Look for git-annex-turtle-…/Build/Products/Release/git-annex-turtle.app

 


## TODO
 * Get context menus working for get and drop
 * after a git annex get if we already have an item highlighted the Finder thumb preview doesn't update? possible to do that? or is there just a delay?
 * and context menu errors, where to display?
 * what icons to display for git files, staged, in a commit, unstaged, etc…, maybe copy what git annex status does
 * rename git-annex-finder process name to 'git-annex-turtle Finder'
 * rename git-annex-mac-cmd to 'git-annex-turtle-cli'
 * on first launch if directory is already showing icons do not appear
 * better logging? what do people use https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7512211/how-to-output-warnings-to-the-console-during-a-build-in-xcode
 
## Notes
 * https://github.com/liferay/liferay-nativity could provide Finder integration for older OSes if needed.

 * Currently UserDefaults is working fine for sharing data between the host app and the Finder Sync extension, but this might not scale for thousands of files, might need to switch to sqLite database, which can be stored in a common location then each target reads/writes to it (or Core Data)

Check if our Finder Sync extension is running:

    pluginkit -m | grep finder

Depending on which target is running, debug output might not show up in the XCode console. But if you launch the system Console app, it should be there.

Check for open files <https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-linux-get-list-of-open-files/>, first get process ID

    ps -aef | grep git-annex
    
Then list open files

    lsof -p <process-id> | less
